---

## 🏗️ BUILD STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Add public visibility tracking to books table
ALTER TABLE books ADD COLUMN is_public_free BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE books ADD COLUMN public_since TIMESTAMP NULL;
ALTER TABLE books ADD COLUMN public_views INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

-- Create public page tracking
CREATE TABLE public_page_views (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  book_id UUID REFERENCES books(id),
  viewer_ip INET,
  viewer_session VARCHAR(255),
  viewed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  is_authenticated BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

-- Create waitlist for non-authenticated users
CREATE TABLE book_waitlist (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  book_id UUID REFERENCES books(id),
  email VARCHAR(255),
  session_id VARCHAR(255),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### 1.2 API Routes to Build
```
/api/public/[username]/free-books (GET)
├── Returns user's public free books
├── Tracks views and engagement
└── No authentication required

/api/books/[id]/mark-public (POST)
├── Moves book from private library to public free pool
├── Removes from friends' browseable library
└── Generates shareable link

/api/books/[id]/public-claim (POST)
├── Handles claims from public page
├── Requires authentication
└── Follows existing claim workflow

/api/public/stats/[book-id] (GET)
├── Real-time viewer count
├── Recent activity
└── Social proof data
```

#### 1.3 State Management Updates
```typescript
// Update book status enum
type BookStatus = 
  | 'available'      // Friends can see/borrow
  | 'borrowed'       // Currently borrowed
  | 'public_free'    // On public shelf only
  | 'claimed'        // Claimed from public shelf
  | 'transferred';   // Ownership transferred

// New UI states
interface PublicBookPage {
  books: PublicFreeBook[];
  ownerInfo: PublicUserProfile;
  viewerCount: number;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  canClaim: boolean;
}
```

### Phase 2: Public Page UI (Week 2)

#### 2.1 Public Shelf Page Component
```typescript
// /public/[username]/free-books page
interface PublicShelfProps {
  username: string;
  books: PublicFreeBook[];
  ownerProfile: PublicUserProfile;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
}
```

**Features:**
- Beautiful book grid layout
- Real-time viewer counts
- Authentication-aware claim buttons
- Social sharing integration
- Mobile-optimized design

#### 2.2 Book State Toggle in Admin
```typescript
// Add to existing BookCard component
<button 
  onClick={() => togglePublicFree(book.id)}
  className="bg-blue-500 text-white px-3 py-2 rounded"
>
  {book.is_public_free ? '🔒 Make Private' : '🌍 Share Publicly'}
</button>
```

#### 2.3 Enhanced Facebook Sharing
```typescript
// Auto-generate social media content
const generateShareContent = (books: PublicFreeBook[]) => ({
  title: `${books.length} Free Books Available! 📚`,
  description: `${books.slice(0,3).map(b => b.title).join(', ')} and more!`,
  image: generateBookGridImage(books),
  url: `https://mylittlelibrary.com/public/${username}/free-books`
});
```

## 🔄 INTEGRATION STRATEGY

### Current System Integration Points

#### 3.1 Modify Existing "Free to Good Home" Flow
```typescript
// OLD: Book stays in friends' library view
// NEW: Book moves to public-only pool

const markFreeToGoodHome = async (bookId: string, makePublic: boolean) => {
  await updateBook(bookId, {
    is_free_to_good_home: true,
    is_public_free: makePublic,
    public_since: makePublic ? new Date() : null,
    // Remove from friends' browseable library if public
    status: makePublic ? 'public_free' : 'available'
  });
};
```

#### 3.2 Enhanced User Settings
```typescript
// Add to user profile
interface UserSettings {
  allow_public_sharing: boolean;
  public_username: string; // Custom URL slug
  public_bio: string;
  public_location: string; // Optional
  email_on_public_claim: boolean;
}
```

#### 3.3 Claim Flow Integration
```typescript
// Existing claim system works, just need source tracking
const claimBook = async (bookId: string, source: 'friends' | 'public') => {
  // Same existing logic
  // Track source for analytics
  await trackClaimSource(bookId, source);
};
```

### 3.4 Navigation Updates
```typescript
// Add to main navigation
const navigationItems = [
  { label: 'My Library', path: '/library' },
  { label: 'Friends', path: '/friends' },
  { label: 'Public Shelf', path: '/public-shelf' }, // NEW
  { label: 'Browse', path: '/browse' }              // NEW
];
```

2. Claims book with one click
3. Follows existing handoff process
```

#### 4.4 Viral Mechanics Testing
```bash
# Conversion Funnel
Facebook Post Views → Public Page Visits → Signups → Claims → New Public Shelves

# Success Metrics
- Public page conversion rate > 5%
- New user activation > 60%
